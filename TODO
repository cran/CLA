* *Before* next CRAN release
** DONE OpenBLAS, ATLAS, etc: must fix file:tests/SP500-ex.R at least: use
  R=/usr/bin/R R-pkg-check CLA # Fedora's R pkg using OpenBLAS
  R=R-3.5.1_MS R-pkg-check CLA # (RMO using MKL)
  R=R-ATLAS    R-pkg-check CLA # using ATLAS
 	see files ./CLA_ATLAS.out ./CLA_MKL.out ./CLA_OpenBLAS.out
* ASAP (but possibly later than CRAN release)
** TODO check arguments  e.g., lB <= uB, sum upper Bounds >= 1
** TODO References --> (mostly done): Make Master thesis web-available (from SfS ETHZ) ?
*** DONE 1) References from the thesis, including the "buried" python-paper with *WRONG* algo
*** TODO 2) Master thesis: I'd like the thesis to be on our web page
** TODO Improve plot() method, using hyperbolic interpolation see  R/CLA.R  man/plot.CLA.Rd
** DONE CLA() should return a (S3) class, "CLA" w/ print() and plot() methods
** DONE findMu() and findSig() regression check examples *before* much changing: tests/findSigMu-ex.R
** DONE A. Norring's Masters thesis has small 10-asset example (from Markovitz & Todd).
   We should add that as a minimally small data set to use in examples,
   e.g. plot().   His thesis is in ~/Betreute-Arbeiten/YanhaoShi/Previous_Work/

** DONE Fixed Bug: did not get the "border case" lambda=0, e.g. for 10a example,
   where others (incl A.Norring) *do* return that.
* With more time, also, e.g., for a short R Journal paper
** SparseMatrix plot of the weights
