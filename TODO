* ASAP (no longer "Before release of package")
** check arguments  e.g., lB <= uB, sum upper Bounds >= 1
** TODO References --> (mostly done)
*** DONE 1) References from the thesis, including the "buried" python-paper with *WRONG* algo
*** TODO 2) Master thesis: I'd like the thesis to be on our web page
** DONE CLA() should return a (S3) class, "CLA" w/ print() and plot() methods
** TODO findMu() and findSig() regression check examples *before* much changing R/findSigMu.R
** TODO Improve plot() method, using hyperbolic interpolation see  R/CLA.R  man/plot.CLA.Rd
** TODO  A. Norring's Masters thesis has a small 12-asset example (from a published source).
   We should add that as a minimally small data set to use in examples,
   e.g. plot(). His thesis is in ~/Betreute-Arbeiten/YanhaoShi/Previous_Work/

* With more time, also, e.g., for a short R Journal paper
** SparseMatrix plot of the weights
